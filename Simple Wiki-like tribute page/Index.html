              <li><time datetime="1882"> 1882 </time>- In 1882, Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle used in alternators and pioneered the use of this rotating and inducting electromagnetic field force to generate torque in rotating machines.</li>
              <li><time datetime="Jun 6 1884"> Jun 6 1884</time>- On 6 June 1884, Tesla first arrived in the United States, in New York City with little besides a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, a former employer.</li>
