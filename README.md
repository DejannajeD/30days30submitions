# 30days30submitions
In this challenge i will upload 30 little to medium size projects in 30 days, one challenge per day. Sometimes I did a little website component and sometimes some javaScript app as a submit. I did it to boost my HTML, CSS &amp; JS skills. I know there is some cliche projects like calculator, to do list, random joke generator etc. but this is great practice for me, so therefore don't mind challenges, i will try to be creative as much i can whit them, and also i will re-upload some of the project in the end, as sone as i finish all of them, the challenge is to finish one everyday so i hope you will appreciate my effort.
